<h3>About me:</h3>

<p>Interested in programming and
    computer security, I have taken
    several
    courses in these areas.
    <br />
    I later enrolled in
    a professionalizing course, belong 6 months full-time,
    with Epicode School.
    <br />
    I delved into the front end
    (HTML & CSS with some libraries and
    frameworks) and consolidated
    JavaScript.
    <br />
    Finished the front end path (with
    specialization in Angular), I
    continued with the back end
    aimed at the knowledge of
    C#, .NET, ASP.NET and SQL.
    <br />
    Now I wish to apply what I have
    learned, for growing professionally.
    <br />
    I love <a href="https://friend.chess.com/gKec9">chess</a>, literature and movies....
